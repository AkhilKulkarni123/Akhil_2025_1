Reflection WILLIAM W

My task was to change the sprite and make it fit the new level theme. My team found a sprite that has no jagged edges and was high quality.

-Studied-
While I was tasked with the player sprite I also was tasked to create a new ending to the level. When trying to add the code for a key door system I had to back trace thought the JS files and find where certain function were bein called and how they worked.

-Learned-
When I was doing my tasks I learned how the game, player, and level worked and were they were being ran and called from. I learned how to add new objects, add images, and integrate some of my own code into the pre existing code

-Mistakes/Errors-
When creating the player sprite I was unable to make the animation play correctly. It was always glitching and seemed off. I resolved this error by using math on how many rows and columns there where and divided to get my height and width for the sprite sheet

REFLECTION - Akhil Kulkarni

I was tasked with initially playing around with some files in my level including changing some key constants to modify the lava speed, the timer for when the lava starts rising to the user sprite. Additionally, I modified and increased/decreased the jump height of the user sprite to increase the level difficulty and how it interacts with the level. I also added a potential new path for users to end the level a different wa, by learning how to add more already-uploaded sprites in different coordinates to aid for a new path to end the level, along with adding coins to the level for the users to collect advance to the next file.

Learned:

I learned how to spawn in and add more sprites that we uploaded in the images file to implement a new, alternate path for the user sprite to advance to the next level. I learned that I can repeat already existing uploaded sprites. I made a new path using the flag and the flying island sprite, but yet to change the helicopter sprite and fully finish adding coins to progress to the end, although we already started.

Studied:

I studied how to change the coordinates of different spawned sprites on the display screen, how constants can change the speed and factor of the factors in the display. I also studied which filed had which data, and how it reflected on the overall game level, like the lava jump height/speed and the sprite path for the alternate game ending method.

Mistakes/Errors:

One of the major mistakes I made was the lack of commits I made, and to correctly change the coordinates of the required sprites quickly and efficiently.
